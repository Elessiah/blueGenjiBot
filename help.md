# BlueGenjiBot developed by Elessiah

## Status

This bot is currently in development, so you may encounter some issues. Don't hesitate to contact me on Discord (elessiah).

For the moment, only the primary function of the inter-server shared space has been finished. It will evolve later, and on my list are:

- Updating messages if the original has been edited
- Adding a cooldown by author (Don't start spamming after reading this line...)
- Increasing security to avoid crashes

For BlueGenji, there are some updates incoming:

- Registering a candidature
- And more...

## How it works

*All the commands except `/help` and `/list-partner` require administrator permission to be used*.

`/list-partner` allow you to see all the channels link to a service.

You can add a `service` *(list below)* to a text channel, then any message sent in this channel with the `signature` of the service will be sent to all the other channels added by the community with the same service, and you will receive their messages.
