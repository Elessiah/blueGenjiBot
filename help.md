# BlueGenjiBot developed by Elessiah

## Status

This bot is currently in development, so you may encounter some issues. Feel free to contact me on Discord (elessiah).

## How It Works

You can add a `service` *(list below)* to a text channel, and any message sent in that channel with the service's `signature` will be shared with all other channels added by the community using the same service, and you'll receive their messages too.

To personalize the experience for each server, filters are available. To reach users you're interested in, add a region (`EU`, `NA`, `LATAM`, `ASIA`) and one or more ranks you're looking for.
